My name is Nitya and I am student at UNiversity of Cincinnati. I have been a software developer for about 4 years. Most my experience lies in backend development. I have worked with Java, Spring framework, SQL, javascript and a little bit of C# and Python.



While I am not actively searching for a position, I heard that there are some software developer positions that are available and that happens to be the same direction that I want to take in my career. 


You will find high level summaries of my job duties andeducation history in my resume. If you want to see some of the projects that I work on in my spare time, see my GitHub profile: github.com/conneraiken and my portfolio site: fittedtech.com (recommendations, some portfolio items and more).



If you check out my github, it is mostly boilerplate projects that are not finalized. I do not feel that they are accurate representations of the quality of work that I bring as a full time employee but it will give you a sense of the technologies that I work with frequently. Most of my work has not been open sourced unfortunately. However, I am more than happy to create a sample web application project to showcase my full stack/dev ops skills.
